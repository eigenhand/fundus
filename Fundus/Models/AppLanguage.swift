/// iOS already has a setting for this — it sits in the system settings under the app and
/// forces a restart. This one takes effect at once.
///
/// What carries it is the bundle: `Bundle.main` gets a subclass slipped underneath it at
/// runtime that redirects every lookup into the chosen `.lproj`. Everything then follows
/// the same choice — `Text`, `String(localized:)`, and an error message that arises deep
/// inside a model and sees no environment.
///
/// `.environment(\.locale, …)` at the root stands beside it and does **not** replace it.
/// It does two other things: numbers, dates and sorting look the way they do in that
/// language, and its change is the nudge on which SwiftUI rebuilds the views — without
/// it the old language would stand until the user tapped somewhere. Whether it would
/// also switch the lookup on its own is not tested here; for the text coming out of the
/// models it would not have been enough anyway.
///
/// The limit stays: system dialogs asking for the camera or the microphone do not belong
/// to the app. They follow the device's language, and for those the texts lie translated
/// in `InfoPlist.xcstrings`.
